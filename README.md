# Data Structures & Algorithm 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to this comprehensive and open-source repository dedicated to exploring and implementing fundamental **Data Structures Journey in Python**!

---

## Overview

This repository serves as a systematic guide and practical collection of various data structures, implemented from scratch using Python. Each structure includes clear code, explanations (often in companion `README.md` files or comments), and practical problem-solving examples.

Whether you're a student looking to solidify your understanding, a developer preparing for technical interviews, or simply eager to dive deeper into how data is efficiently organized and manipulated in computer science, this resource is designed to be clear, comprehensive, and easy to follow.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized into distinct modules, covering the most common and essential data structures:

- **01-Arrays_and_Lists**: Explore static and dynamic arrays, Python's built-in list functionalities, and fundamental operations.
- **02-Linked_Lists**: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, along with their core operations.
- **03-Stacks_and_Queues**: Implement LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) Stacks and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) Queues, often using both array and linked list backbones.
- **04-Trees**: Covers various tree structures, including Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and their traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order).
- **05-Graphs**: Different graph representations (adjacency list/matrix) and fundamental graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), as well as common graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, Prim's, Kruskal's, Topological Sort).
- **06-Hash_Tables**: Implementations of hash tables, demonstrating collision resolution techniques like separate chaining and open addressing.
- **07-Other_Structures**: (Optional/Planned) - For more specialized or less common data structures like Disjoint Sets, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, etc.
- **`problems/` folders**: Within each data structure's section, you'll find dedicated subfolders containing specific algorithmic problems that leverage the concepts of that data structure, often with solutions provided.
